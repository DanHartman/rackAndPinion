// by Leemon Baird, 2011, Leemon@Leemon.com
//http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5505  "

//Modifications by racatack June 2016:
// v1.0, 6/24/16:
//  -Incorporated 'module InvoluteGear_rack()' from the 11/11/15 comment by quisam2342 in thing:5505 to fix noted problems in rack generation at various tooth sizes
//  -Added a section for an optional 'backboard' that can be used to stiffen an otherwise skinny rack
//  -Added sections for optional Stop Blocks at either or both ends of a rack
//  -Removed extra gears from the example since I only need one pinion. See thing:5505 example section to gain more insight into gear generation.
//v1.1, 6/28/16:
//  -Added sections to optionally create mounting flanges on the bottom/backside of the rack. Flanges can be at either or both ends, or longitudinal.

//TO GENERATE A CUSTOM RACK AND PINION ENTER INPUTS AT LINES 345-377

// This is parameterized involute spur (or helical) gear.  It is much simpler and less powerful than
// others on Thingiverse.  But it is public domain.  I implemented it from scratch from the 
// descriptions and equations on Wikipedia and the web, using Mathematica for calculations and testing,
// and I now release it into the public domain.

//
// The module gear() gives an involute spur gear, with reasonable defaults for all the parameters.
// Normally, you should just choose the first 4 parameters, and let the rest be default values.
// The module gear() gives a gear in the XY plane, centered on the origin, with one tooth centered on
// the positive Y axis.  The various functions below it take the same parameters, and return various
// measurements for the gear.  The most important is pitch_radius, which tells how far apart to space
// gears that are meshing, and adendum_radius, which gives the size of the region filled by the gear.
// A gear has a "pitch circle", which is an invisible circle that cuts through the middle of each
// tooth (though not the exact center). In order for two gears to mesh, their pitch circles should 
// just touch.  So the distance between their centers should be pitch_radius() for one, plus pitch_radius() 
// for the other, which gives the radii of their pitch circles.
//
// In order for two gears to mesh, they must have the same mm_per_tooth and pressure_angle parameters.  
// mm_per_tooth gives the number of millimeters of arc around the pitch circle covered by one tooth and one
// space between teeth.  The pitch angle controls how flat or bulged the sides of the teeth are.  Common
// values include 14.5 degrees and 20 degrees, and occasionally 25.  Though I've seen 28 recommended for
// plastic gears. Larger numbers bulge out more, giving stronger teeth, so 28 degrees is the default here.
//
// The ratio of number_of_teeth for two meshing gears gives how many times one will make a full 
// revolution when the the other makes one full revolution.  If the two numbers are coprime (i.e. 
// are not both divisible by the same number greater than 1), then every tooth on one gear
// will meet every tooth on the other, for more even wear.  So coprime numbers of teeth are good.
//
// The module rack() gives a rack, which is a bar with teeth.  A rack can mesh with any
// gear that has the same mm_per_tooth and pressure_angle.
//
// Some terminology: 
// The outline of a gear is a smooth circle (the "pitch circle") which has mountains and valleys
// added so it is toothed.  So there is an inner circle (the "root circle") that touches the 
// base of all the teeth, an outer circle that touches the tips of all the teeth,
// and the invisible pitch circle in between them.  There is also a "base circle", which can be smaller than
// all three of the others, which controls the shape of the teeth.  The side of each tooth lies on the path 
// that the end of a string would follow if it were wrapped tightly around the base circle, then slowly unwound.  
// That shape is an "involute", which gives this type of gear its name.

I've set it to '-height-backboard_height-d1-mm_per_tooth' to give a proportionate offset that allows for ease of printing for most sets of gear & rack parameters. If you use a large NEGATIVE backboard height THE GEAR AND RACK MAY OVERLAP. That can be fixed by substituting some other number/formula for '-height-backboard_height-d1-mm_per_tooth'. Try for example -3*d1, or just subtract an additional fixed offset from what's in there now (e.g. (-height-backboard_height-d1-mm_per_tooth)-14.)
